abstract = {The discrete dipole approximation (DDA) has been widely used to study light scattering by nonmagnetic objects. The electric field inside an arbitrary scatterer is found by solving a dense, symmetric, linear system using, in general, an iterative approach. However, when the scatterer has a nonzero magnetic susceptibility, the linear system becomes nonsymmetric, and some of the most commonly used iterative methods fail to work. We study the scattering of light by objects with both electric and magnetic linear responses and discuss the efficiency of several iterative solvers for the nonsymmetric DDA.},

abstract = {3-D refractive index (RI) distribution is an intrinsic bio-marker for the chemical and structural information about biological cells. Here we develop an optical diffraction tomography technique for the real-time reconstruction of 3-D RI distribution, employing sparse angle illumination and a graphic processing unit (GPU) implementation. The execution time for the tomographic reconstruction is 0.21 s for 963 voxels, which is 17 times faster than that of a conventional approach. We demonstrated the real-time visualization capability with imaging the dynamics of Brownian motion of an anisotropic colloidal dimer and the dynamic shape change in a red blood cell upon shear flow.},
